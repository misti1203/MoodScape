# **Moodscape: Emotion-Driven Terrain Synthesis for Virtual Reality Systems**  

### **Overview**  
**Moodscape** is an automated framework designed to generate emotion-driven terrains for Virtual Environments (VEs). By leveraging a novel **DH-CVAE-GAN** architecture, the framework synthesizes realistic terrains that align with specified affective inputs, reducing the need for extensive expertise and manual effort. This project explores the largely unexamined relationship between terrain characteristics and user emotions, offering groundbreaking applications in gaming, therapeutic simulations, and more.

### **Highlights**  
- **Emotion-Driven Terrain Synthesis**:  
  Investigates how terrain features in VEs influence human emotions, complementing existing studies on lighting and color effects.  
 
- **User Study for Emotional Correlation**:  
  Participants rated emotional responses to various 3D terrains using the **Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)** scale (valence, arousal, dominance).  

- **Innovative GAN Architecture**:  
  Introduces **DH-CVAE-GAN**:  
  - **Generator**: Dual-Head Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DH-CVAE).  
  - **Discriminator**: Ensures effective and realistic terrain generation.  

- **Realistic Terrain Generation**:  
  Trained on satellite-based Digital Elevation Models to ensure terrains mimic real-world geography.  

- **Applications**:  
  - **Gaming**: Enhances immersive gameplay with emotion-aligned environments.  
  - **Therapeutic Simulations**: Facilitates emotion-regulating virtual experiences.  
  - **Beyond**: Suitable for diverse VE-based applications.

### **Getting Started**  
Video Overview: Mood-Based Terrain Generation
In the video, we demonstrate the functionality of the VR system, where users can input mood parameters (Valence and Arousal) via a UI panel using a controller. Based on the selected mood values, the system generates a terrain that corresponds to the emotional state. The UI panel also offers additional options, such as selecting specific terrain types for direct generation and an option to play music. While the music selection feature, which generates terrain based on the mood of the music, is beyond the scope of this journal, it adds another layer of interactivity.
The video further illustrates how varying Valence and Arousal inputs influence the generated terrain, showcasing environments such as Mountain, Desert, Plateau, and Coastal regions. Initially, we developed the system for four terrain types, but as discussed in the paper, it can be extended to generate up to eight terrain types. The video provides a clear visualization of how these mood-based inputs alter the virtual environments in real-time.
