# **Moodscape: Emotion-Driven Terrain Synthesis for Virtual Reality Systems**  

### **Overview**  
**Moodscape** is an automated framework designed to generate emotion-driven terrains for Virtual Environments (VEs). By leveraging a novel **DH-CVAE-GAN** architecture, the framework synthesizes realistic terrains that align with specified affective inputs, reducing the need for extensive expertise and manual effort. This project explores the largely unexamined relationship between terrain characteristics and user emotions, offering groundbreaking applications in gaming, therapeutic simulations, and more.

---

### **Highlights**  
- **Emotion-Driven Terrain Synthesis**:  
  Investigates how terrain features in VEs influence human emotions, complementing existing studies on lighting and color effects.  
 
- **User Study for Emotional Correlation**:  
  Participants rated emotional responses to various 3D terrains using the **Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)** scale (valence, arousal, dominance).  

- **Innovative GAN Architecture**:  
  Introduces **DH-CVAE-GAN**:  
  - **Generator**: Dual-Head Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DH-CVAE).  
  - **Discriminator**: Ensures effective and realistic terrain generation.  

- **Realistic Terrain Generation**:  
  Trained on satellite-based Digital Elevation Models to ensure terrains mimic real-world geography.  

- **Applications**:  
  - **Gaming**: Enhances immersive gameplay with emotion-aligned environments.  
  - **Therapeutic Simulations**: Facilitates emotion-regulating virtual experiences.  
  - **Beyond**: Suitable for diverse VE-based applications.

### **Architecture**  
The **DH-CVAE-GAN** comprises:  
- **Dual-Head Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DH-CVAE)**:  
  - Generates terrains based on affective input conditions.  
- **Discriminator**:  
  - Validates the realism of generated terrains.  

---

### **Dataset**  
- Trained on a comprehensive dataset of **satellite-based Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)**.  
- Ensures high fidelity and realism in terrain synthesis.  

---

### **Evaluation**  
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Assessed the accuracy of terrain alignment with affective inputs.  
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Verified realism and emotional relevance of generated terrains.
